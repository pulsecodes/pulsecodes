## Why I have almost 4000 commits/my intro.
 All of my commits are in private repositories, things I don't want to leak the source code of, [my discord click me <3](https://discord.gg/SVBWAz7rKp). I would love to share these with you guys, however it is just not possible for me to reveal these without people skidding these projects, Such as vplaza, not pointing fingers of course. Also
I just like to code I enjoy it as a hobby (9 hrs a day), I guess that pretty much sums up alot of things, I love making api's, making websites in various different languages such as astro, react (jsx and tsx), nextjs, vite, svelte, (im like beginner in some of this stuff except react and astro) I think everyone knows json, well I do so 👏 I own [Seyo](https://seyo.dev) I also know tailwind html css js, a lil tailwind not too much, and I am a cheapskate, I am always my way or the highway, such as me finding free platforms for my things... I am also a white-hat hacker, and love firebase (since it is easily penetrable) of course if it is in the frontend and you are a skid and have:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
apiKey: "AIzaSyB_XyZa1bC2dEfGhIjK3lMnOpQrS4tUv5",
authDomain: "firebase-config-83927.firebaseapp.com",
projectId: "firebase-config-83927",
storageBucket: "firebase-config-83927.appspot.com",
messagingSenderId: "102938475610",
appId: "1:102938475610:web:AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv",
measurementId: "G-HJ8KLMN12P",
};
```
(not a real firebase config)
you should just implement it in your backend, don't dm me about "how to connect frontend to backend in the language node.js" like please just don't. Also if you aren't gonna buy a server and stick to github pages static/w3spaces, atleast add rules to your firebase so people can't abuse it. Well this is enough ranting for one day, you probably didn't read all of this but I don't expect you to this is me letting out my feelings on vplaza + explanation on my commits for yalls wondering peace!
